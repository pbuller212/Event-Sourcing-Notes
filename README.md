# Event Sourcing Notes

This is my attempt at improving my software development skills through the study of Event Sourcing.

I initially heard about through an [episode](https://coder.show/616) of the [Code Radio podcast](https://coder.show/) podcast with Adam Dymitruk. Listening, it touched on some of the pain points I have experienced as a developer and working with clients and other stakeholders.

The quote that had me hooked was "__It is developers understanding, not your business knowledge that becomes software.__" I have found this to be true, as there is often a disconnect between what the business wants and the project delivered.

I purchase the books Understanding Event Sourcing by Martin Dilger. These are my notes going through the book.
