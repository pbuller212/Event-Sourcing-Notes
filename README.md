# Event Sourcing Notes

This is my attempt at improving my software development skills through the study of Event Sourcing.

I initially heard about through an [episode](https://coder.show/616) of the [Code Radio podcast](https://coder.show/) podcast with Adam Dymitruk. Listening, it touched on some of the pain points I have experienced as a developer and working with clients and other stakeholders.

I purchase the books Understanding Event Sourcing by Martin Dilger. These are my notes going through the book.

## Other resources

After I heard the podcast with Adam Dymitruk, there has been another podcast episode on Django Chat featuring Chris May. Another resource to explore.
